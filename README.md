## Pyber Charts

This is a visualization project where I use matplotlib library to explore the market opportunity for an imaginary ride-sharing company "Pyber". The analysis is based on company's dataset that contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

##Findings
1. Clearly, the biggest opportunity for Pyber lies in the rural and suburban rides. The figure below demostrates that rural and suburban areas are largely underserved having the least number drivers and yet the highest ride-sharing fares.
